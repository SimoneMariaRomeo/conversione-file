Day 1 – 14h-18h
Icebreaker – The Dark Side of the MoonThe convention starts with an icebreaker where participants reflect about what’s important for themselves and share it, giving them the opportunity of know each other better.Participants draw an album cover representing who they are and choose a theme song. They share it in trios.They then send a photo of their drawing and a link to their song to the cell phone number of one of the facilitators.At strategic moments throughout the three days, the facilitators will share some of the covers with the songs, and participants try to guess who it is related to.The person then will have one minute to share their choice.

Day 1 – 14h-18h
Option 1: EMEApolis
Divided into teams, participants are invested in creating a common project that requires sharing, timely decisions and creative solutions.Team members are given a mandate by the mayor to build the Ideal City in which they want to live. The subgroups have to build the different neighbourhoods of the city in 3D, one per group, which represent the essential elements for the Team to thrive in the year to come.In addition, various unexpected setbacks will force the groups to transform the project as it progresses. A celebration will take place through the assembly of the model, followed by a debrief that helps set the base for the next day.Skills:Cross-functional collaborationIntegration between rolesFlexibility with respect to changeConstant alignmentAccountability
After the icebreaker, there will be an energizing activity to be chosen between 3 options.

Slide 7
Day 1 – 14h-18h
After the icebreaker, there will be an energizing activity to be chosen between 3 options.
A creative setting where participants collaborate around a shared goal: the reproduction and reinterpretation of famous musicals. An event filled with suspense, twists and turns, group rehearsals and individual talents.It is an opportunity to bring hidden talents to the surface, shake up the usual dynamics and enhance mutual understanding. Each group will create a 5 minutes version of famous Broadway show. A series of rehearsals and moments of coordination lead to the grand finale, celebrating this collaborative work. Certain realization constraints ensure not only the quality of the result, but also participatory ways of realization (e.g., there must be at least two collective choreographies of one minute each in the script, and a singing or acting part).SkillsCross-functional collaborationCommon Purpose Orientation: One Team, One Vision AccountabilityTalent enhancement

Day 1 – 14h-18h
After the icebreaker, there will be an energizing activity to be chosen between 3 options.
Participants are divided into teams to embark on a treasure hunt, navigating through a series of challenges to uncover the next clue. Each successfully completed challenge reveals a numerical value that teams must protect.While some challenges are tackled in subgroups, there are crucial moments when all teams must collaborate to progress towards the treasure. The treasure is eventually found and represents the collaboration towards success.This activity offers a fantastic opportunity for participants to get to know each other, fostering a sense of group cohesion and belonging as they work towards a common goal.Skills: Cross-functional cooperationChanges in perspective and contextTalent enhancementAccountabilityProblem solving

Day 2 – 9h-18h
Icebreaker Mystery CandiesThis icebreaker will provoke participants to interact, discover more about each other and reinforce the sense of community.Participants receive candies whose packaging contain actions aimed at sharing and integration, which must be carried out not only at that moment, but also over the course of the 2nd and 3rd days.Each time they do one of the actions, they put the package in a jar. Facilitators will read out some of the packages on the last day, an invite participants to share how the experience was.Examples of actions:Share with a colleague a situation in which they made a difference to youChoose a colleague to tell how they could help you in some daily situationTell a colleague with whom you interact less about one of your strengthsShare with a colleague what belonging to a team means to youThey will have time to do 1 of the actions during the icebreaker, and then can pick up other candies and do the other actions throughout the convention.

Slide 10
Day 2 – 9h-18h
Metaplan: Fly to 2025After the icebreaker, we go through a structured process to guide the discussion about the team and the non-negotiables, and how to translate them into specific actions. The entire process lasts all day and is alternated with fun moments of sharing the activity “The Dark Side of The Moon”, inspirational videos and storytelling from facilitators to help bring more clarity.1. Alignment of the non-negotiablesDivide NN for countries and then for region.  After a brief sharing of the pillars for 2025, we ensure the non-negotiables are clear and agreed to everyone.2. Moonlight and Moon ShadowParticipants discuss about what currently facilitates and what hinders the non-negotiables. 3. BrainstormingIn subgroups focused on each topic, participants brainstorm how to make them alive. A few rounds of brainstorming are done, and participants have the opportunity to discuss other topics (we can have them go around and discuss each topic at a time, going through all of them, or make 2 additional rounds where they can individually choose different topics, so they will discuss it with different people).4. Action planIdeas are organized according to categories and ranked, considering the creativity and feasibility criteria. Up to 3 ideas are chosen by each group, and they than work on a detailed action plan for each idea. They get prepared to present the action plans the next day.
